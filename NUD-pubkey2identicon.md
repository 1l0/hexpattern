# NUD: Pubkey to identicon

This NUD defines how to convert pubkey to identicon.

![pubkey to identicon](https://github.com/1l0/hexpattern/blob/master/images/pubkey_identicon.png?raw=true)

[Live demo](https://1l0.github.io/hexpattern/)

## Why?

- `npub` is nonsense to display.
  - too long.
- `npub1bla...bla` is nonsense to display.
  - `npub1` takes too much space.
  - `...` means nothing.
